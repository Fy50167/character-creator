## Description

Full-stack application that combines MongoDB on the back-end and React Three Fiber on the front-end to allow users to create 3D characters. Once creating an account, users can create characters on the create page by giving characters a name, description, and class which decides the character's 3d model. Created characters can be freely viewed/deleted on the profile page, but creations are also posted to the community page for other users to see and view (characters can only be deleted by the owner). The profile page also features username, tagline, and profile picture customization.

## Usage

Application can be installed by running the following commands:

```console
git clone git@github.com:Fy50167/character-creator.git
npm install

```
